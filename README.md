# TFG: Quantum theory-Time reversal
This repository contains all the necessary programs (in MatLab) and results obtained from the TFG "Quantum theory - Time reversal"
It is divided in two parts, "Evolution and time reversal of a free particle" and "Evolution of a particle inside an infinite potential well"
## Evolution and time reversal of a free particle
This folder contains all the programms needed to simulate a free particle following the Copenhagen interpretation as well as a packet of free particles with a gaussian distribution on the initial dispersion of the position. These programms also allow to obtain the resulting images of the simulation, but still a folder with the images and results from the simultaion used for the TFG is uploaded too.
## Evolution of a particle inside an infinite potential well
This folder contains all the programms needed to simulate a particle inside an infinite potential well following the Copenhagen interpretation as well as a packet of free particles with a gaussian distribution on the initial dispersion of the position. These programms also allow to obtain the resulting images of the simulation, but still a folder with the images and results is uploaded too.
